# Plaid-Shell

__INTRODUCTION__

This repo contains the final project for Introduction to System Software Engineering (ISSE), focusing on the creation of Plaid Shell (plaidsh). The goal of this project is to develop a fully-featured shell for Linux systems.

__DESCRIPTION__

In this final project, we brought together the concepts learned throughout the semester to develop plaidsh, a Linux shell. Unlike previous assignments, this project required to construct the shell from scratch, utilizing the techniques and approaches covered in class.

__FEATURES__

**Tokenization**: Handles five token types and handling them effectively.
**Input/Output Redirection**: Managing input/output redirection using TOK_LESSTHAN, TOK_GREATERTHAN, and pipes (TOK_PIPE).
**Built-in Commands**: Implementing built-in commands such as exit, quit, author, cd, and pwd.
**Child Process Handling**: Creating child processes using fork() and executing commands with execvp().
**Interactive Editing**: Providing interactive editing functionalities similar to common shells.
**Tab Completion**: Basic tab completion of filenames.

__FILES__
- **token.h**: Defines the Token data structure used to represent various tokens.
- **tokenize.h** and **tokenize.c**: Tokenization functions for processing user input into tokens.
- **clist.h** and **clist.c**: A simple linked list implementation that allows to store a list of tokens. The CList library is used to store the tokens generated by the tokenizer.
- **parser.h** and **parser.c**: A parser for converting tokens into an abstract syntax tree that represents the user's command.
- **pipeline.h** and **pipeline.c**: A library for creating and storing commands pipeline.
- **plaid.c**: The main program that gathers input, tokenizes it, parses it, and evaluates the commands.
- **Makefile**: A Makefile for compiling the Plaid-Shell program and running the automated tests.
- **README.md**: This file.
- Test files.

__USAGE__

To use Plaid-Shell follow these steps:

1. Compile the project using the provided Makefile. Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
make
```
1. Run the Plaid-Shell program:
```bash
./plaid
```
1. Enter commands and run them interactively. Type them and press Enter to see the result.
2. To exit Plaid-Shell  press "CTRL+C".

Some example inputs and outputs:

```bash
$ ./plaidsh
Welcome to Plaid Shell!

```

__IMPORTANCE__

Plaid-Shell is a fully-featured shell for Linux systems. It is a great tool for learning about the inner workings of shells and how they are implemented.
